# Recommendations from LLM Systems
To help inform what a sound approach is for developing 
the project, different AI LLM Systems were consulted for 
their suggestions.

## Prompt
I want to develop a system that reads legal text in Spanish, for Costa Rica law and derives  a series of facts and rules that can layer be used by a symbolic reasoning system using Logic Programming, to answer questions related to the text. Some example question may a form such as "are there any contradictions in this body of laws?", or "is it legal or allowed to do such and such".

Act as an AI expert in Natural Language Processing and Understanding and either a) recommend a fully open source system that has the described capability, or b) describe the main components and steps to build such a system, using open source frameworks only.

Developing a system to extract facts and rules from legal text in Spanish and apply symbolic reasoning is a challenging task. I'll outline the main components and steps to build such a system using open-source frameworks.

*System Overview*

The proposed system consists of the following components:

1. *Natural Language Processing (NLP)*: to analyze and understand the legal text.
2. *Information Extraction (IE)*: to extract relevant facts and rules from the text.
3. *Knowledge Representation (KR)*: to represent the extracted knowledge in a structured format.
4. *Symbolic Reasoning (SR)*: to apply logical rules and answer questions.

*Component 1: NLP*

For Spanish NLP tasks, you can use:

- *spaCy*: a popular open-source NLP library with support for Spanish. It provides tokenization, entity recognition, language modeling, and more.
- *Stanza*: another powerful NLP library with support for Spanish, providing high-performance, streamlined processing of text data.

*Component 2: IE*

For extracting facts and rules, you can use:

- *Rule-based approach*: define regular expressions or use libraries like *spaCy's Matcher* to extract specific patterns from the text.
- *Machine Learning-based approach*: train models using annotated datasets to extract relevant information. Libraries like *spaCy's EntityRuler* or *Stanza's NER* can be fine-tuned for this purpose.

*Component 3: KR*

To represent the extracted knowledge, you can use:

- ** triples (subject-predicate-object)**: a simple, widely-used format for representing knowledge graphs.
- ** ontologies**: more complex knowledge representation frameworks that define concepts, relationships, and rules.

For implementing KR, you can use libraries like *RDFlib* (for RDF triples) or *OWLAPI* (for ontologies).

*Component 4: SR*

For symbolic reasoning, you can use:

- *Prolog*: a logic programming language that's well-suited for implementing rule-based systems. *SWI-Prolog* is a popular open-source implementation.
- *Answer Set Programming (ASP)*: another logic programming paradigm that can be used for knowledge representation and reasoning. *Clingo* is a popular open-source ASP solver.

*System Steps*

1. *Text Preprocessing*: clean and normalize the legal text using NLP libraries.
2. *Fact Extraction*: apply IE techniques to extract relevant facts and entities.
3. *Rule Extraction*: extract rules and regulations using IE techniques or manual annotation.
4. *Knowledge Representation*: represent the extracted knowledge in a structured format (e.g., triples or ontologies).
5. *Symbolic Reasoning*: implement a rule-based system using Prolog or ASP to apply logical rules and answer questions.

*Open-Source System Recommendation*

While there isn't a single, fully open-source system that meets all your requirements, you can combine the above components to build a system that suits your needs. Some projects that might be worth exploring are:

- *The OASIS project*: an open-source framework for legal knowledge representation and reasoning.
- *LegalRuleML*: an XML-based language for representing legal rules and regulations.

*Example Implementation*

Here's a high-level example of how you could implement the system using spaCy, RDFlib, and SWI-Prolog:
```
import spacy
from rdflib import Graph
import subprocess

Load Spanish NLP model
nlp = spacy.load("es_core_news_sm")

Process legal text
text = "Art√≠culo 1. La ley establece..."
doc = nlp(text)

Extract facts and rules
facts = []
for ent in doc.ents:
    facts.append((ent.text, ent.label_))

Represent knowledge in RDF triples
g = Graph()
for fact in facts:
    g.add((fact[0], fact[1], fact[2]))

Serialize RDF graph
g.serialize("knowledge_graph.ttl")

Call SWI-Prolog to apply logical rules
subprocess.run(["swipl", "-f", "rules.pl", "-g", "consult('knowledge_graph.ttl')"])
```
This example is a starting point, and you'll need to develop a more comprehensive system to meet your specific requirements.

Keep in mind that building such a system will require significant development and testing efforts. You may need to adapt and extend existing open-source components to fit your specific use case.

### Is the above a practical approach for avoiding hallucinations from an NLP system processing legal content?  Are there any more practical and effective approaches?
[2025-04-26, 06:13], via WhatsApp.

The approach I outlined can help mitigate hallucinations in NLP systems processing legal content, but it may not be the most practical or effective approach for several reasons:

1. *Complexity*: The system requires multiple components, including NLP, IE, KR, and SR, which can lead to complexity and integration challenges.
2. *Domain expertise*: Legal domain expertise is essential for defining rules, annotating data, and validating the system's output.
3. *Data quality*: The system's performance relies heavily on the quality of the training data, which can be challenging to obtain and annotate in the legal domain.

More practical and effective approaches to avoiding hallucinations in NLP systems processing legal content might include:

1. *Constrained generation*: Use techniques like constrained decoding or structured prediction to ensure the generated text adheres to specific formats or templates.
2. *Fact-checking*: Implement fact-checking mechanisms to verify the accuracy of generated text against trusted sources or databases.
3. *Knowledge graph-based approaches*: Represent legal knowledge as a graph and use graph-based algorithms to generate text that is grounded in the graph's structure and content.
4. *Hybrid approaches*: Combine symbolic and neural AI approaches to leverage the strengths of both paradigms. For example, use neural networks for text generation and symbolic reasoning for validation and verification.
5. *Training data curation*: Carefully curate and annotate training data to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and relevant to the legal domain.
6. *Evaluation metrics*: Use evaluation metrics that prioritize factual accuracy, such as fact-based metrics or metrics that assess the system's ability to retrieve relevant information.
7. *Human oversight*: Implement human oversight and review processes to detect and correct hallucinations in generated text.

Some specific techniques that might be useful for avoiding hallucinations in legal NLP systems include:

1. *Named Entity Recognition (NER)*: Use NER to identify and extract specific entities (e.g., laws, regulations, court cases) and ensure they are accurately represented in generated text.
2. *Relation extraction*: Extract relationships between entities and use these relationships to inform generated text.
3. *Dependency parsing*: Analyze the grammatical structure of text to ensure generated text is syntactically correct and semantically meaningful.

Ultimately, the most effective approach will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your project. It's essential to carefully evaluate different approaches and techniques to determine the best fit for your use case.

### First answer
[2025-04-26 13:34](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-want-to-develop-a-system-tha-f_U8hvLJST2_wEgdwfMxqQ)

To develop a system that reads Spanish legal texts (specifically Costa Rican law), extracts facts and rules, and enables symbolic reasoning with logic programming to answer questions such as contradictions or legality, you have two main paths: using existing open source resources or building a system from components. Below is a detailed expert recommendation based on open source frameworks and research.

1. Existing Open Source Resources for Spanish Legal Text Processing
  * Legal-ES: This is an open source resource kit 
   specifically for Spanish legal text processing. It includes a very large corpus (over 1 billion words) of legislative and administrative documents in Spanish from various jurisdictions, along with pre-trained word embeddings and topic models tailored to legal language. The corpus is preprocessed with SpaCy, and embeddings are generated with Gensim, making it suitable for downstream NLP tasks like information extraction, semantic similarity, and topic navigation in legal texts.

    * [LegalNLP - Natural Language Processing methods for 
     the Brazilian Legal Language](https://www.academia.edu/79909964/LegalNLP_Natural_Language_Processing_methods_for_the_Brazilian_Legal_Language)

  * LegalNLP: Although primarily focused on Brazilian 
Portuguese, LegalNLP offers methods and tutorials for legal text manipulation that could inspire similar approaches for Spanish legal texts.

     the Brazilian Legal Language](https://github.com/felipemaiapolo/legalnlp)
    * [LegalNLP - Natural Language Processing methods for 
     the Brazilian Legal Language](https://www.academia.edu/79909964/LegalNLP_Natural_Language_Processing_methods_for_the_Brazilian_Legal_Language)

These resources provide a solid foundation for Spanish legal language understanding and can be adapted or extended for Costa Rican law.

2. Main Components and Steps to Build the System Using 
   Open Source Frameworks

A. Legal Text Preprocessing and Representation

Use SpaCy with Spanish language models to tokenize, lemmatize, and parse legal texts. SpaCy supports custom pipelines and can be extended with domain-specific models.

Apply Legal-ES embeddings or train domain-specific embeddings with Gensim on Costa Rican legal corpora to capture legal semantics.

Optionally, use topic modeling (e.g., LDA) to understand thematic structures in the texts.

B. Legal Information Extraction
Develop or fine-tune named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction models to identify:

Legal entities (laws, articles, institutions)

Facts (case-specific details)

Rules and conditions stated in the law

This can be done by adapting transformer-based models (e.g., BERT multilingual or BETO for Spanish) fine-tuned on annotated legal datasets or using distant supervision from Legal-ES resources.
  * [Connecting Symbolic Statutory Reasoning with Legal 
Information Extraction](https://aclanthology.org/2023.nllp-1.12.pdf)

Use rule-based patterns to complement statistical models, especially for extracting logical conditions and legal references.

C. Formalization into Logic Programming
Translate extracted facts and rules into a logic programming language such as Prolog or Answer Set Programming (ASP).

Frameworks like PROLEG have been used for formalizing laws and reasoning with legal facts in logic programming, integrating fact extraction with symbolic reasoning.
* [Beyond Logic Programming for Legal Reasoning](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3437/paper2LPLR.pdf)

The process involves mapping natural language rules to logical predicates and facts, enabling queries like contradiction detection or legality checks.

D. Symbolic Reasoning and Query Answering
Use a logic programming engine (e.g., SWI-Prolog, Clingo for ASP) to:

Check for contradictions by querying conflicting rules or facts.

Determine legality by evaluating whether certain conditions satisfy legal rules.

Integrate the reasoning engine with the NLP pipeline to allow end-to-end question answering.

E. Optional: Deep Learning Integration
Enhance fact extraction accuracy by fine-tuning deep learning models on legal text queries and their corresponding logical representations.

Explore end-to-end models that combine information extraction and reasoning, though these are still research topics.

Summary Recommendation

Aspect | Tools/Resources | Purpose
----- | ----- | -----
Corpus & Embeddings | Legal-ES (SpaCy, Gensim) | Spanish legal text representation
NLP Pipeline | SpaCy (Spanish models), Transformer models (BETO) | Tokenization, NER, relation extraction
Information Extraction | Fine-tuned deep learning models + rule-based patterns | Extract facts and legal rules
Logic Programming | PROLEG framework, SWI-Prolog, ASP (Clingo) | Formalize and reason about laws/facts
Reasoning & Querying | Logic programming engines | Contradiction detection, legality queries

No fully integrated open source system currently exists that directly performs all these steps for Spanish legal texts and logic-based reasoning out-of-the-box. However, combining Legal-ES for language resources, SpaCy and transformer models for NLP, and PROLEG or other logic programming frameworks for reasoning provides a feasible and fully open source approach to build your system.

NLP tools like SpaCy and transformer models can be adapted for Spanish legal text processing.

This architecture will allow you to extract structured facts and rules from Costa Rican legal texts and perform symbolic reasoning to answer complex legal queries such as contradictions or legality assessments.

### How can I integrate Legal-ES with a logic programming framework
To integrate Legal-ES-a large Spanish legal text corpus and embedding resource-with a logic programming framework for symbolic legal reasoning, you need to bridge natural language legal knowledge extraction and formal logic representation. The integration involves several key steps and components, combining NLP and logic programming tools:

1. Use Legal-ES for Legal Text Processing and Fact/Rule Extraction
Preprocessing and Embeddings: Use Legal-ES resources (SpaCy pipelines, word embeddings) to preprocess Costa Rican legal texts, including tokenization, lemmatization, and semantic representation. This step prepares the text for deeper analysis by capturing legal terminology and context in vector form.

Information Extraction: Apply or fine-tune NLP models (NER, relation extraction) on Legal-ES data to extract structured legal facts, entities (laws, articles, actors), and rules expressed in natural language. This can be enhanced by transformer models fine-tuned on Legal-ES or similar corpora.

2. Translate Extracted Facts and Rules into Logic Programming
Mapping to Logic Predicates: Convert extracted legal facts and rules into logical predicates suitable for a logic programming language such as Prolog or Answer Set Programming (ASP). For example, a legal rule expressed in Spanish can be formalized as a Prolog clause.

Frameworks: Use logic programming frameworks like PROLEG or standard Prolog engines (e.g., SWI-Prolog) or ASP solvers (e.g., Clingo). PROLEG is designed for legal reasoning and can integrate facts from text with symbolic reasoning.

3. Neuro-Symbolic Integration (Optional but Recommended)
Recent research advocates a neuro-symbolic approach that combines deep learning (LLMs) with logic programming. You can use LLMs to generate or assist in generating logic encodings of legal text extracted from Legal-ES, then validate and execute these in a logic programming environment to improve accuracy and explainability.
* https://arxiv.org/html/2502.17638v1

This approach can automate the transformation of natural language legal text into logic rules, with iterative correction via logic program execution feedback.

4. Reasoning and Query Answering
Once legal knowledge is encoded in the logic programming system, you can perform queries such as contradiction detection or legality checks by querying the logic engine.

The logic programming system can provide explanations for decisions, supporting transparency and trustworthiness.

Summary Workflow

Step | Tools/Resources | Description
----- | ----- | -----
Legal Text Processing | Legal-ES (SpaCy, embeddings) | Preprocess and extract semantic features from text
Information Extraction | Transformer models, rule-based patterns | Extract facts and rules from legal text
Logic Encoding | PROLEG, SWI-Prolog, Clingo | Map extracted info to logic predicates and rules
Neuro-Symbolic Assistance | LLMs + logic programming (e.g., SWISH) | Automate and refine logic encoding from text
Reasoning & Querying | Logic programming engines | Execute queries, detect contradictions, check legality

Practical Integration Tips
Start by preprocessing Costa Rican legal texts with Legal-ES pipelines to obtain clean, semantically rich representations.

Develop or adapt extraction models to identify legal statements and conditions.

Define a clear schema for mapping extracted elements to logic predicates (e.g., permits(action), prohibits(action), contradiction(rule1, rule2)).

Use PROLEG or SWI-Prolog to encode and reason over these predicates.

Consider leveraging LLMs fine-tuned on Legal-ES data to assist in generating logic encodings, then validate them with the logic engine to reduce errors.
* https://arxiv.org/html/2502.17638v1

Build an interface layer that connects NLP output to logic input and allows querying and explanation generation.

By combining Legal-ES‚Äôs rich Spanish legal language resources with a logic programming framework and optionally neuro-symbolic methods, you can create a robust system that extracts, formalizes, and reasons over Costa Rican legal texts effectively.

### What are the best logic programming frameworks for integrating with Legal-ES

The best logic programming frameworks for integrating with Legal-ES, a Spanish legal text resource, are those that support formalizing legal rules and facts extracted from text, enable symbolic reasoning, and ideally facilitate neuro-symbolic integration with language models. Based on recent research and practical use cases, the following frameworks stand out:

Recommended Logic Programming Frameworks

Framework | Description & Strengths | Notes on Integration with Legal-ES and NLP
---- | ---- | ----
SWI-Prolog | A mature, widely used Prolog environment with extensive libraries and tooling. Supports symbolic reasoning and querying of legal rules. | Proven effective in legal reasoning projects (e.g., CodeX) and can be combined with NLP outputs from Legal-ES for logic encoding and querying. [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.17638v1) [4](https://law.stanford.edu/2023/03/10/why-a-logic-programming-approach-works-for-automating-insurance-contracts/) [5](https://openreview.net/forum?id=AsTWBjCvUt). Integrates well with LLMs for neuro-symbolic approaches [1].
Epilog | An extension of Prolog with enhanced expressivity and scope, used in legal automation projects like CodeX. | Provides richer expressivity for complex legal contracts and rules, suitable for detailed Costa Rican law formalization [4].
Answer Set Programming (ASP) (e.g., Clingo) | A declarative logic programming paradigm supporting non-monotonic reasoning, useful for modeling exceptions and conflicting rules. | Used in legal decision modeling and explanation tools (e.g., Italian criminal law modeling) with good support for explainability and inconsistency detection [7](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3733/short3.pdf).
s(CASP) | A top-down ASP solver with explanation capabilities, enabling justifications of legal decisions. | Useful for explainable legal reasoning, though with scalability trade-offs. Can complement Legal-ES extracted knowledge [7].
PROLEG | A legal reasoning framework integrating logic programming for formalizing laws and reasoning. | Designed specifically for legal text formalization and reasoning, can be adapted to work with Legal-ES extracted facts and rules [1].
ProSLM | A Prolog-based language model framework validating LLM outputs against domain-specific legal knowledge bases. | Enhances factual accuracy and interpretability by combining LLMs and Prolog for legal question answering [1].
Alda | A newer language integrating logic rules with sets, functions, and objects, supporting concurrent and distributed programming. | Allows seamless integration of logic rules with other programming paradigms, potentially useful for complex legal systems [6](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/theory-and-practice-of-logic-programming/article/integrating-logic-rules-with-everything-else-seamlessly/43F7B71F2B4A27FAB6BFF7EFC0C58EF6).

Integration Considerations with Legal-ES
From Legal-ES to Logic Programs: Use Legal-ES‚Äôs SpaCy pipelines and embeddings to preprocess and extract structured facts and rules from Spanish legal texts. Then map these extracted elements into logic predicates compatible with the chosen logic programming framework.

Neuro-Symbolic Synergy: Recent work shows prompting LLMs 
to translate legal text into logic programs (e.g., 
Prolog clauses) improves accuracy and reasoning 
consistency. Frameworks like SWI-Prolog and ProSLM 
facilitate this integration by executing and validating 
LLM-generated logic encodings. [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.17638v1) [5](https://openreview.net/forum?id=AsTWBjCvUt)

Explainability and Contradiction Detection: ASP solvers 
like Clingo and s(CASP) support non-monotonic reasoning 
and provide explanations for legal decisions, which is 
crucial for detecting contradictions and understanding rule interactions extracted from Legal-ES.[7](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3733/short3.pdf)

Scalability and Usability: SWI-Prolog offers robust tooling and community support, making it a practical choice for initial development. Epilog and Alda provide advanced expressivity for more complex legal rule sets.

Summary

Framework | Best Use Case in Legal-ES Integration
--- | ---
SWI-Prolog | General-purpose legal reasoning, neuro-symbolic integration
Epilog | Complex legal contracts requiring enhanced expressivity
ASP / Clingo | Modeling exceptions, contradictions, and explainable reasoning
s(CASP) | Explainable top-down reasoning with justification
PROLEG | Legal-specific logic programming framework
ProSLM | Validating and refining LLM-generated legal logic encodings
Alda | Integrating logic with other programming paradigms

These frameworks provide a solid foundation to formalize and reason over legal knowledge extracted from Legal-ES, enabling you to build a system that answers complex legal queries with symbolic logic and explainability.

## ChatGPT's answer
[2025-04-27 5:00](https://chatgpt.com/c/680e0d7e-1ee8-8000-85da-c03101a70379)

### Initial anwwer
Got it ‚Äî you're looking for an open source solution for automatically extracting facts and rules from legal Spanish texts (Costa Rican law) to feed a symbolic reasoning system (like Prolog, ASP, Datalog, etc.) to answer deep legal questions (e.g., contradictions, permissions).

I'll give you a careful expert answer, organized exactly how you asked:
First (a): check if there‚Äôs a ready system,
then (b): detailed plan to build one if needed.

(a) Are there fully open source systems that already do this?
Short answer:
‚Üí No full system exists that does exactly all of what you described, especially for Spanish legal texts.
There are partial pieces: parsers, knowledge extraction tools, legal ontologies, but no complete "out-of-the-box" solution.

Closest open tools or components:

spaCy + spaCy Spanish models ‚Äî fast, strong open-source NLP foundation for Spanish

Stanford CoreNLP ‚Äî supports Spanish; excellent for parsing, dependency analysis (important for logical structure).

LeXeMe (Legal Knowledge Extraction in Multilingual Environments) ‚Äî EU project, open source, but it's mostly English-focused.

LUIMA (Legal Information Extraction and Entailment) ‚Äî old, in English only.

Legal-ES ‚Äî a small Spanish legal corpus used for some NLP experiments.

RoboLaw, CODEX projects ‚Äî conceptual designs, but no full open system.

Summary:
There are open frameworks that help process legal text, but not a complete pipeline from Costa Rican Spanish legal text to logical rules and fact bases.

(b) How to build such a system? (using fully open source components)
Here's a realistic architecture for your project:

1. Preprocessing (Text cleaning & normalization)
Goal: Clean raw legal texts (PDFs, DOCs, websites) into structured, plain Spanish text.

Tools:

pdfminer.six or Apache Tika for extracting text.

spaCy Spanish tokenizer for basic tokenization.

Custom cleaning rules for weird formatting typical in legal docs (e.g., "Art√≠culo", Roman numerals).

2. Linguistic Analysis (Parsing)
Goal: Understand the grammatical structure deeply.

Tools:

spaCy + es_core_news_lg (large Spanish model)
‚Üí POS tagging, dependency parsing.

Stanford CoreNLP (Spanish models)
‚Üí Deeper constituency parsing (phrases and clauses).

Why important?
Laws have modalities ("must", "may", "must not"), conditionals ("if... then..."), exceptions, negations ‚Äî parsing identifies them.

3. Legal Knowledge Extraction (facts, rules)
Goal: Identify and extract:

Entities (e.g., "person", "contract", "government agency")

Relations ("must pay", "is authorized to")

Modality (obligation, permission, prohibition)

Conditionals (if-then structures)

Tools:

Custom extraction rules using spaCy's Matcher or Ruler components.

Dependency pattern matching to catch "modality + verb + object" constructions.

Transformers (e.g., roberta-base-bne or BETO fine-tuned for legal Spanish)
‚Üí For more flexible extraction.

Example Output:

```prolog
```
must(person(X), pay(contract(Y))).
prohibited(company(X), dismiss(employee(Y))).
if(late(payment(X)), penalty(imposed(X))).
4. Semantic Representation (Logical Forms)
Goal: Formalize extracted facts/rules into a logical language.

Options:

Prolog predicates

Answer Set Programming (ASP) rules

Datalog facts

You must define an ontology for the domain:

Actions: pay/2, dismiss/2

Roles: employee/1, company/1

Modalities: must/2, may/2, prohibited/2

Conditions: if/2

5. Reasoning Engine (Symbolic Inference)
Goal: Given facts and rules, answer deep questions.

Tools:

SWI-Prolog (best open-source Prolog system)

Clingo (ASP solver)

Datalog Engines like LogicBlox (if you need database integration).

Example capabilities:

Contradiction detection:
If both must(X, do(Y)) and prohibited(X, do(Y)) exist ‚Üí contradiction.

Permission checking:
Query for may(X, do(Y)) or must(X, do(Y)) or prohibited(X, do(Y)).

6. Question-Answering Interface (Optional)
Goal: Allow users to input natural language questions.

Options:

Map NL questions ‚Üí logic queries via templates.

Use Rasa NLU or simple intent classification models.

Example:
"Is it legal for a company to fire an employee for being pregnant?"
‚Üí Map to:

```prolog
```
prohibited(company(X), dismiss(employee(pregnant(Y)))).
‚Üí Then query the knowledge base.

### Please sketch a more detailed plan
Perfect! Let‚Äôs dive deep and lay out a detailed practical plan, step-by-step, for Ubuntu 24.10.
I'll include specific libraries, what to code first, dev environment setup, and example prototype milestones.

üõ†Ô∏è 1. Development Environment Setup
On your Ubuntu 24.10:

Basic System Packages:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv openjdk-21-jre-headless git make gcc
```
* Python 3 (standard)
* Java 21+ (needed for Stanford CoreNLP)

üõ†Ô∏è 2. Create Python Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv legal-nlp-env
source legal-nlp-env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

üõ†Ô∏è 3. Install NLP Libraries
Inside the legal-nlp-env:

```bash
pip install spacy stanza transformers torch
pip install pdfminer.six
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```
spacy ‚Äî NLP toolkit

stanza ‚Äî Stanford's official Python NLP wrapper (with Spanish)

transformers ‚Äî HuggingFace models (if needed for semantic extraction)

pdfminer.six ‚Äî PDF text extraction

fastapi + uvicorn ‚Äî later, if you want a lightweight API.

Download Spanish models:

```bash
python -m spacy download es_core_news_lg
python -m stanza.download('es')
```
üõ†Ô∏è 4. Download Stanford CoreNLP (optional for deeper parsing)
```bash
mkdir corenlp
cd corenlp
wget https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-corenlp-latest.zip
unzip stanford-corenlp-latest.zip
cd ..
```

You can interact via stanza or REST API.

üõ†Ô∏è 5. Install Symbolic Reasoner (Prolog)
```bash
sudo apt install swi-prolog
```
SWI-Prolog is powerful, open source, very well-documented.

Optionally for ASP:

```bash
sudo apt install clingo
```
üìã 6. Project Structure
```plaintext
legal_reasoning_project/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/                  # Raw legal texts (input)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extraction/             # Code to parse and extract facts/rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logic_base/             # Output: Prolog facts/rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reasoning/              # Querying and contradiction checking
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/                    # (Optional) REST API with FastAPI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/                 # Fine-tuned NLP models (optional)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                # CLI scripts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

üöÄ 7. Development Plan (Milestones)
Milestone 1: Basic Text Extraction
Input: Costa Rica law PDFs

Goal: Get clean text.

Task:

Use pdfminer.six to extract text.

Normalize (remove extra spaces, line breaks).

Prototype Code:

```python
from pdfminer.high_level import extract_text

def extract_text_from_pdf(path):
    return extract_text(path)

raw_text = extract_text_from_pdf('data/law_example.pdf')
print(raw_text[:1000])
```
Milestone 2: Basic Syntactic Parsing
Input: Cleaned text

Goal: Tokenize sentences, extract grammatical structure.

Task:

Use spaCy Spanish model.

Prototype Code:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("es_core_news_lg")

def parse_sentences(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    for sent in doc.sents:
        print(sent.text)

parse_sentences(raw_text)
```
Milestone 3: Modalities Extraction (Obligation, Permission, Prohibition)
Input: Sentences

Goal: Find patterns like "debe", "puede", "prohibido".

Strategy:

Use spaCy‚Äôs Matcher.

Define patterns for obligation/permission.

Prototype Code:

```python
from spacy.matcher import Matcher

matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)

pattern_must = [{"LEMMA": "deber"}, {"POS": "VERB"}]
pattern_can = [{"LEMMA": "poder"}, {"POS": "VERB"}]
pattern_prohibited = [{"LOWER": "prohibido"}]

matcher.add("MUST", [pattern_must])
matcher.add("CAN", [pattern_can])
matcher.add("PROHIBITED", [pattern_prohibited])

def extract_modalities(doc):
    matches = matcher(doc)
    for match_id, start, end in matches:
        span = doc[start:end]
        print(f"Detected {nlp.vocab.strings[match_id]}: {span.text}")

doc = nlp(raw_text)
extract_modalities(doc)
```
Milestone 4: Fact and Rule Extraction
Input: Modalities + Subjects + Actions

Goal: Generate simple logical rules.

Example mapping:

X debe Y ‚Üí must(X, Y).

X puede Y ‚Üí may(X, Y).

X est√° prohibido de Y ‚Üí prohibited(X, Y).

Store facts into .pl files (Prolog source files).

Milestone 5: Symbolic Reasoning (Prolog)
Goal: Load facts and answer questions.

Prototype Prolog file (knowledge_base.pl):

```prolog
must(persona(pedro), pagar(contrato(alquiler))).
prohibited(empresa, despedir(mujer_embarazada)).

contradicts(Action) :- must(X, Action), prohibited(X, Action).
```
Run Query:

```prolog
?- consult('knowledge_base.pl').
?- contradicts(Action).
```
Find contradictions automatically!

Milestone 6: Optional: Simple Question-Answering API
Set up a FastAPI server:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import subprocess

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/check_permission")
def check_permission(action: str):
    query = f"may(_, {action})."
    result = subprocess.run(["swipl", "-s", "logic_base/knowledge_base.pl", "-g", query, "-t", "halt"], capture_output=True)
    return {"result": result.stdout.decode()}
```
üìà Later improvements:
Train a Transformer on Costa Rican legal text for better extraction.

Handle exceptions ("excepto", "salvo que").

Build a contradiction graph (show visually where laws conflict).

‚ú® Summary Table

Step | Tools | Deliverable
