## Libraries

### Flair
A very simple framework for state-of-the-art NLP. Developed by Humboldt University of Berlin and friends.
* [On Github](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair)
* [Flair Documentation Page](https://flairnlp.github.io/docs/intro) - Initial tutorials.
* [Latest release](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/releases): 0.15.1, Feb 5 2025

### [spaCy](https://spacy.io)
  * A popular open-source NLP library with 
    support for Spanish. It provides tokenization, entity recognition, language modeling, and more.
    * → POS tagging, dependency parsing.
  * [Usage](https://spacy.io/usage)
  * [Mastering spaCy - Second Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-spacy/9781835880463/)
  * [NLP_APP](https://github.com/sharonreshma/NLP_APP)
    * This Streamlit-based application leverages spaCy, a leading NLP library, to perform advanced text processing tasks. Users can analyze text by tokenizing, visualizing part-of-speech tags, identifying named entities, and performing lemmatization.
  * [NLP Pipeline with SpaCy & TextBlob](https://github.com/AqueeqAzam/Complete-NLP-pipeline-using-SpaCy)
    * This project implements a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline using SpaCy and TextBlob. It covers text processing, named entity recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, rule-based matching, and more, making it useful for chatbots, search engines, sentiment analysis, and text summarization.

### [Stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza)
Another powerful NLP library with support for 
  Spanish, providing high-performance, streamlined processing of text data.

### Stanford CoreNLP
Supports Spanish; excellent for 
parsing, dependency analysis (important for logical structure).
  * → Deeper constituency parsing (phrases and clauses).

### [TextBlob](https://github.com/sloria/TextBlob)
  * [https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)
  * TextBlob is a Python library for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, and more.

### [FreeLing](https://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/)
  * Could not install it in Ubuntu 24.10 - Oracular Oriole*

  FreeLing is a C++ library providing language analysis functionalities (morphological analysis, named entity detection, PoS-tagging, parsing, Word Sense Disambiguation, Semantic Role Labelling, etc.) for a variety of languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, German, Russian, Catalan, Galician, Croatian, Slovene, among others).


## Tools

* **pdfminer.six** or Apache Tika for extracting text.


## Languages and Frameworks

* **Prolog**: a logic programming language that's well-suited 
for implementing rule-based systems.
  * **SWI-Prolog** is a popular open-source implementation.
* **Answer Set Programming (ASP)**: another logic programming 
  paradigm that can be used for knowledge representation and reasoning.
  * **Clingo** is a popular open-source ASP solver.
  * **ASP in Swi-Prolog**
    * [s(CASP) SWISH site](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/example/scasp.swinb)
    * [s(CASP) for SWI-Prolog](papers/sCASP for Swi-Prolog gdeinvited4.pdf)
      * Jan Wielemaker, Joaquín Arias and Gopal Gupta4 
        https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2970/gdeinvited4.pdf

* **Datalog** Engines like `LogicBlox` (if you need database integration)
* **RDFlib (for RDF triples)**: a simple, 
widely-used format for representing knowledge graphs.
* **OWLAPI (for ontologies)**: more complex knowledge representation 
  frameworks that define concepts, relationships, and rules.

## Projects with similar Objectives

* **The OASIS project**: an open-source framework for legal 
knowledge representation and reasoning.
* **LegalRuleML**: an XML-based language for representing 
  legal rules and regulations.
* [Legal-ES](papers/Legal-ES-2020.lt4gov-1.6.pdf). This is an open source resource kit 
specifically for Spanish legal text processing
* **LegalNLP**

  * [Repo](https://github.com/felipemaiapolo/legalnlp)
* [Connecting Symbolic Statutory Reasoning with Legal 
Information Extraction](https://aclanthology.org/2023.nllp-1.12.pdf)
* Frameworks like **PROLEG** have been used for formalizing laws and reasoning with legal facts in logic programming, integrating fact extraction with symbolic reasoning.
  * [pdf](papers/paper2LPLR.pdf)
  * [Beyond Logic Programming for Legal Reasoning](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3437/paper2LPLR.pdf)
* **LeXeMe** (Legal Knowledge Extraction in Multilingual 
  Environments) — EU project, open source, but it's mostly English-focused.
