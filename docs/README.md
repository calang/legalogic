## Recommendations from LLM Systems
Compiled [here](Arch_Recom_from_LLMs.md).

## Libraries

* **spaCy**: a popular open-source NLP library with support for Spanish. It provides tokenization, entity recognition, language modeling, and more.
* **Stanza**: another powerful NLP library with support for 
  Spanish, providing high-performance, streamlined processing of text data.

## Languages and Frameworks

* **Prolog**: a logic programming language that's well-suited 
for implementing rule-based systems. **SWI-Prolog** is a popular open-source implementation.
* **Answer Set Programming (ASP)**: another logic programming 
  paradigm that can be used for knowledge representation and reasoning. **Clingo** is a popular open-source ASP solver.
* **RDFlib (for RDF triples)**: a simple, 
widely-used format for representing knowledge graphs.
* **OWLAPI (for ontologies)**: more complex knowledge representation 
  frameworks that define concepts, relationships, and rules.
